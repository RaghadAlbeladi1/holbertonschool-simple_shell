# C - Simple Shell ðŸŽ“
## Description
**Simple Shell** is an implementation of our own simplified version of a UNIX command line interpreter written in C. The objective of this project is to build a shell from scratch that mimics basic behaviors of traditional UNIX shells. While limited in functionality, it applies the core concepts of process creation, command execution, environment variables, and input handling. In simple terms, a shell is a program that takes commands typed by the user and passes them to the operating system for execution. Our shell supports interactive and non-interactive modes, uses `execve` to execute commands found in the `PATH`, and includes basic built-ins like `exit` and `env`, excluding advanced features such as piping, redirection, or cursor movement.

This project was collaboratively developed by [**Raghad Albeladi**](https://github.com/RaghadAlbeladi1), [**Najwa Aljunaidel**](https://github.com/NajwaAljunaidel), [**Bushra Alotaibi**](https://github.com/Bushra2252), as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Requirements
- GCC version 9.4.0 or newer (currently using 11.4.0 on Ubuntu 22.04)  
- Operating System: **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (sandbox environment)  
- `make` utility (optional but recommended)

## Compilation / Installation
**The code should be compiled this way:**
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c -o hsh
```
**What does it do?**
This command is used to strictly compile all C files in our project. It helps ensure the code is:

âœ… Clean and free from common bugs

âœ… Following C89 coding standards

âœ… Compiled with any warning treated as an error

### ðŸ”½ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghadAlbeladi1/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
cd holbertonschool-simple_shell

Below is a breakdown of the main files in this repository, displayed as badges with descriptions:

- [![shell.h](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell.h-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/shell.h)  â†’ Contains all function prototypes, macros and necessary header includes for our shell.

- [![shell.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell.c-green?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/shell.c) â†’ Implements the REPL loop: reads user input, parses it, and dispatches commands.

- [![getenv.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/getenv.c-yellow?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/getenv.c) â†’ Defines a custom `_getenv`â€‘style function to fetch environment variable values.

- [![tools.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/tools.c-orange?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/tools.c) â†’ A collection of helper utilities for string handling, memory management and error reporting.

- [![command.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/command.c-red?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/command.c) â†’ Locates executables on the `$PATH` and executes them with the provided arguments.

- [![man_1_simple_shell](https://img.shields.io/badge/man__1__simple__shell-lightgrey?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/hedjouj/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/man_1_simple_shell) â†’ The formatted manâ€‘page for your shell (sectionÂ 1), describing usage, options and examples.
  ## Example
```bash
$ ./hsh
simple_shell$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
simple_shell$ ls -1
AUTHORS
README.md
built-ins.c
execute.c
hbtn_ls
hsh
prompt.c
shell.c
shell.h
tools.c
user_input.c
simple_shell$ exit
$
```
**In this session:**
- Started the shell with `./hsh`
- Ran a simple `echo` command
- Listed directory contents with `ls -1`
- Exited cleanly with `exit`
